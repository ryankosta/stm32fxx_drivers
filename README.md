# stm32fxx_drivers
stm32f4xx_drivers educational project

I am writing this code along with a course called Mastering Microcontroller with embedded development.

This is not meant to be used in any production scenario.
This is a personal project with the goal of learning more about MCUs and embedded development.

This code likely has many errors as I am still learning the technologies at play. Feel free to suggest any changes or point out mistakes.

This project is designed in the stm32cubeide development and build environment, with the stm32f4discovery in mind.
It could easily be adapted to another build environment.
Adapting it to another microcontroller would be nontrivial as it is an API specifically designed for the STM32F4 series MCUs.
